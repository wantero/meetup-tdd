This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.16.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

The Cypress schematic we have installed wraps these commands so they integrate with Angular.

`ng run $project-name$:cypress-run` – Starts an Angular development server (ng serve), then calls npx cypress run.\
`ng run $project-name$:cypress-open` – Starts an Angular development server (ng serve), then calls npx cypress open.\

`$project-name$` is a placeholder. Insert the name of the respective Angular project. This is typically the same as the directory name. If not, it can be found in angular.json in the projects object.
